**Not Face Blind** is a simple web application that detects faces in images. In order to use the application, users must register, and login upon subsequent visits to the site. However, **USER DATA IS NOT USED FOR ANYTHING**. Feel free to use fake information.

*This is the **back-end** repository. For the front-end, see: [not-face-blind](https://github.com/spencerericfong/not-face-blind).*

The back-end of this project includes a RESTful API as well as a relational database for users and logins. The server was built in Javascript, using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. The database stores user and login information, and was created using **PostgreSQL**. The site itself is hosted and deployed on [**Heroku**](https://heroku.com/).
